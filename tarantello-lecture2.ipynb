This means we will want to have $e^u (1 - e^u) \\in L^1 (\\mathbb{R}^2).$ This ramifies into two possible scenarios so there are two types of vortices in the planar case. The conditions are $u \\rightarrow 0$ as we go to infinity (**Class 1**) in the plane or $u \\rightarrow - \\infty$ as we go to infinity (**Class 2**) in the plane. \n",

Physically, $|\\phi|^1 = 1$ corresponds to the material in the superconducting state. The fact that $u<0$ reveals therefore that the vortices are not in pure superconducting state. So, this makes good sense.\n",

You perform the argument by contradiction with a scaling and nondegeneracy argument. "
