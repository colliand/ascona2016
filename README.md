# On Jupyter Notebooks and the Slides

Several people asked for information on how I prepared these slides. I was inspired in part by [this article in Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) together with this [interactive example](http://www.nature.com/news/ipython-interactive-demo-7.21492?article=1.16261).

My talks were written using [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) using a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). The slides were rendered from the notebook for presentation using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE), based on [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). The source code was stored and made available to the world on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I linked my notebooks from GitHub to [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to simplify reading of the slides.


I followed the [Jupyter Notebook installation directions](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and used [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to set up the underlying compute process on my local machine. The Jupyter Notebook can also be set up with a remote server hosting the underlying compute process. You can easily experiment with the notebook (without having to install anything other than a modern browser) by clicking on this link: [Try Jupyter](https://try.jupyter.org/). I'm working with my colleagues at [PIMS](http://www.pims.math.ca/) to deploy a [hub for hosting Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.pims.math.ca) and a Canada-hosted Github service available to researchers at our member universities.
