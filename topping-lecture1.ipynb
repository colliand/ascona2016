We can then consider *local complex coordinate* $z = x+iy$ where $(x,y)$ are isothermal coordinates (not unique, but you can do this). Same story for the cotangent bundle. You can then decompose the complex cotangent bundle into two subbundles and arrive at these in a geometric way (as shown in the notes) spanned by $dz = dx + i dy$ and $d \\overline{z} = dx - i dy$. You can then take the dual to do the same for the tangent bundle.
