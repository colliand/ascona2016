After passing to a subsequence and after pulling back by diffeomorphisms $f_i: M \\rightarrow M$, we can find curves as above (independent of $i$) such that the length of the corresponding geodesics is bounded independently of $i$. There is an implicit lemma here due to Bers. Another intuitive to way to say it, you can pick diffeomorphisms so that you can select the smallest geodesics. From here you are beginning to see one of the highlights of this theory, which is an observation of compactness.\n",
